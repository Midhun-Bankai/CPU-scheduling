# CPU-scheduling
First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) Scheduling is the simplest CPU scheduling algorithm. In this method, processes are executed in the order they arrive in the ready queue, like a queue in a supermarket. The process that arrives first gets the CPU first, and once a process starts execution, it runs until completion (non-preemptive).
